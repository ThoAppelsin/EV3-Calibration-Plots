====== Week 3: [TODO] ======

This weeks assignment is about observing and knowing the limits of the tools we have in our hands.
We get to experiment and see to which extent we can depend on the EV3 Sensors and Actuators.

Calibration is a detailed process that should be carried out using extremely precise tools and in an
extraordinarily meticulous fashion. The tape measures, rulers and protractors we buy from supplies
stores are definitely not proper tools for a good calibration. The techniques we employ, also
are very crude to be used in professional calibration procedures.

Nonetheless, it is an assignment with benefits to give us more chance to experiment with the
sensors and actuators of EV3, as well as to provide us the first-hand experience on how
dependable they are, especially with their accuracy and limits.

====== Mechanical Design ======

We have made minor redesigns to our robot from its previous iterations. Most notably, we have changed
the support structure for the ultrasonic sensor to make it face directly to the front, parallel to the ground.
Previously, it was headed ever so slightly towards the floor, like most of the humans do with their heads.
The purpose for this was to eliminate any calibratory measurement issues, which could arise if we were to measure
the robot's distance from an obstacle over a plane parallel to the ground, although the ultrasonic sensor would
measure an inclined distance.

We were also breaking the connections from the sensors that were not in use in each section,
to make sure that the robot dedicates all its power to the task in hand.

Ultrasonic, color-light and gyro sensors were used during this experiment, along with the two
regulated motors.

====== Software Design ======

We omit the exact code for the software carrying out the tasks for calibratory measurements,
for that they are almost exactly the same with the previously used, and examplary codes for
Basic Components.

For the gyro sensor's part, we have used a modified version of gyro sensor's Basic Components code,
and removed the turning behavior from it. For the motor's forward motion, we modified the Basic
Components' ''MotorControl.java'', and removed everything but the forward motion from it.
Similarly, we used the same base code for the rotational motion.

We have prepared our calibratory codes to make EV3 robot perform all the necessary actions
one after another, waiting for a button press in between. This way, we did not have to
re-upload the code from our computers to it, but simply just reset its position and
press the button on it between measurements. The way we prepared the code, it would perform
each task 5 times, and then advance to the next stage, i.e. from speed 100 to 200,
requiring us to upload code merely 5 times to the robot for the entire experiment.

One important thing to note is that we have used ''stop(true)'' for stopping the motors
whenever needed, to make the stopping methods work asynchronously than in a blocking fashion
they do by default. The robot, otherwise, would wait for one of its wheels to stop before
stopping the other, which could take more-than-necessary amount of time for non-mechanical reasons.

====== Results and Discussion ======

Here we will show you the results in regression lines, means and standard deviations.

===== Sensor Calibration =====

As can also be seen on the graph, the ordinary least squares linear regression model
for the ultrasonic sensor data is ''y = 0.406 + 1.007x''.

The means and standard deviations for the 5-fold
readings on each one of the 12 actual distances
can be found in the following table. We also have
included the mean and standard deviation for
both the y-intercept and the slope of the linear model
to the table:

==== Light-Color Sensor ====

Following 6 graphs are for Light-Color Sensor's
readings as it was pointed at Yellow, Red, Green,
Blue, Pink and Orange papers. Each graph
is for a paper color, and on each graph,
4 different readings are noted for RGB
(Red, Green, Blue) color channels, and the
light intensity measurement, also known as
the ambient value. Each channel has analysis
for both readings in dark (in blue tinted bars),
and under the light (in orange tinted bars).

There are in total 48 measurements depicted,
all with 95% confidence intervals.
All of the measurements are given in percentage values.
Note that graphs have the maximum percentage of
70, and not 100, to show a more fine-grained view.

{{ week3lightcolor }}

The means and standard deviations for the 5-fold
readings on each one of the 2 different ambient
light circumstances (light and dark), 6 different
paper colors (Yellow, Red, Green, Blue, Pink, Orange),
and 4 different channels (Red, Green, Blue, Intensity),
and in total 48 different combinations, can be found
in the following table. Note that each cell contains a
tuple, with first being the mean, and second being the
standard deviation:

==== Gyro Sensor ====

{{ week3gyro }}

As can also be seen on the graph, the ordinary least squares linear regression model
for the gyro sensor data is ''y = 3.55 + 0.988x''.

The means and standard deviations for the 5-fold
readings on each one of the 10 actual angular offsets
can be found in the following table. We also have

===== Motor Calibration =====

This part consists of calibratory measurements and results on linear and rotational motion.

==== Linear Motion ====

{{ week3linear }}

As can also be seen on the graph, the ordinary least squares linear regression model
for the ultrasonic sensor data is ''y = 0.0 + 1.223x''.
Here, we have explicitly set our model to have
its y-intercept at the origin, since there is
an implicit hard measurement that with no speed
there will be no movement.

The means and standard deviations for the 5-fold
trial of letting the motors run for 5 seconds
at 9 different speeds and measuring the distance
the robot has travelled can be found in the
following table. We also have included the mean
and standard deviation for just the slope of the
linear model to the table:

^ Parameter ^ Mean   ^ Standard Deviation ^

==== Rotational Motion ====

{{ week3rotational }}

As can also be seen on the graph, the ordinary least squares linear regression model
for the ultrasonic sensor data is ''y = 0.0 + 2.009x''.
Here, we have explicitly set our model to have
its y-intercept at the origin, since there is
an implicit hard measurement that with no speed
there will be no movement.

The means and standard deviations for the 5-fold
trial of letting the motors run for 5 seconds
at 10 different speeds and measuring the angle
the robot has rotated can be found in the
following table. We also have included the mean
and standard deviation for just the slope of the
linear model to the table:

===== Discussion over the motor speed and acceleration =====

We have noticed that although the motors have a electro-physical limit to the speed at which
they may turn, they may be assigned with higher speeds which the robot retains.
On top of that, we noticed that the acceleration parameter we set does not act upon the motor
physically, but merely modifies the retained speed value.

Let us assume that the physical speed limit for the robot is 1000.
For the reasons above, the robot may be set to move forward at a speed 5000, and
accelerate/decelerate at 1000 units/second rate. As a result, as the robot moves,
it will not move at any different speed than if it were set to move at the speed 1000,
because that's the electro-physical limit, but when the motors are told to stop,
it will take 5 seconds for them to stop, while it would take only 1 second, had its
speed been set to 1000 instead.

This had been the most sensible explanation we had to the surprising outcomes we had
on the Linear Motion part of this experiment. We could clearly hear that
the motors were exerting same amount of force from the sound they were making,
but the robot would proceed further than before when we increased the speed to 1500
from the previous 1000. We then noticed that the robot clearly moves for longer
than 5 seconds as we started testing and measuring for the higher speeds, 3000 and 5000,
which brought us into thinking of the explanation we've made above.

===== Discussion over the gyro sensor's planarity =====

When we were making the gyro sensor's calibratory measurements, we noticed
a worrying increase in the measured angles by the gyro sensor, as we were
measuring the same angle for 5 consecutive times. This got us to thinking,
and looking for the ways to reproduce and manipulate.

We observed ourselves, specifically how we shuffle and shake the robot
in between sensor readings. We were lifting the robot, and we were making
a circular twist movement with our wrists at a fixed position in the air.
We were making the twist in the clockwise direction, and the reading would
then increase. We tried making the twist in the counter-clockwise direction,
then we noticed that this time the reading would decrease. At all times,
we were laying down the robot at the same orientation as before.

Our explanation to this was that the gyro sensor's way of measuring its orientation
was dependent on standing perpendicular against the gravity, i.e. parallel
to the ground at all times. For a better understanding, we then thought of this
extreme case:

Assume that we were to put the robot at the edge of a hemi-circle shaped bowl,
looking upwards. If we were to pivot it about the center of the circle, like
we were doing with our wrists, and bring it all the way to the opposite side of the
circular edge of the bowl, then the robot would start looking downwards.
Essentially, half a twist at a 90 degree angle like the way we described above
would be like a 180 degree turn from the robot's point of view, turned from looking
above to looking down.

By this reasoning, we did not only understand why the readings were changing tremendously
despite the fact we were placing the robot at the exact same orientation, but it also
started making sense that it changed the way it changed.

For this experiment, we then started over and noted down the sensory measurements without
lifting the robot as we twisted and turned the robot in between the readings.
